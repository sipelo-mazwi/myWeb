        <h2>Latin language</h2>
        <p>I would love to learn this language because it helps us to understand the derivation of many words; it is an aid to learning further languages; and it is a wonderful source of important European literature. It is not likely you will ever speak to a Latin speaker. However, Latin is woven through our speech, our books, some professions etc.</p>

                <li>The South African Museum was founded in 1825. In 1897 the Museum moved to its present building in the historic Company's Garden. Since then millions of visitors have wandered its halls and corridors to be stimulated and inspired by its collections and exhibitions. They have left the Museum with a better understanding of the earth and its biological and cultural diversity, past and present.</li>
                <li>For every object on exhibition at the South Museum, there are thousands more carefully stored away. The Museum houses more than one and a half million specimens of scientific importance.
                    For nearly 200 years scientists at the Museum have been adding to these collections and studying them.</li>
                <li>Without museum collections we would have no permanent record of extinct animals like dinosaurs. Neither would we have examples of artefacts made by our ancestors two million years ago or cultural objects used by people over the centuries.</li>
